# Versions

tsift is private software, but its command surface is still versioned explicitly.

Canonical binary version source: `Cargo.toml` `package.version`. The CLI exposes the same value via `tsift --version`.

Use `BREAKING CHANGE:` prefix in version entries to flag incompatible changes.

## 0.1.4

- `tsift index --prune` now falls back to the same full file-mtime scan as normal incremental indexing, so file edits inside unchanged directories are still detected correctly.
- The `--prune` flag remains in place as a compatibility surface and reports prune stats, but active subtree skipping is suspended until tsift has a sound invalidation model that cannot miss in-place file edits.

## 0.1.3

- `tsift index` now records non-fatal warnings when a changed file cannot be read or when symbol/call extraction fails, instead of silently swallowing those `.ok()` paths.
- Those warnings are emitted on stderr from shared index-update flows and also carried in the structured `IndexSummary`, so manual indexing and search autoindex no longer hide partial extraction failures.

## 0.1.2

- Writable `index.db` opens now set and verify `PRAGMA wal_autocheckpoint=256`, so routine tsift writes checkpoint the WAL on an explicit budget instead of relying on SQLite defaults.
- Regression coverage now asserts the busy timeout, WAL journal mode, and explicit auto-checkpoint setting together.

## 0.1.1

- `tsift search --timeout` now runs the bounded sift search in an internal helper process and kills that worker on timeout, so timed-out searches no longer keep burning CPU in detached threads.
- `--timeout 0` still keeps search in-process for long-running sessions that explicitly opt out of the timeout.

## 0.1.0

- Initial private versioned release surface for the tsift CLI.
- Commands available: `index`, `search`, `graph`, `communities`, `path`, `explain`, `edit`, `route`, `rewrite`, `sql`, `audit`, `summarize`, `lint`, `status`, `init`.
- Global output controls available: `--compact`, `--pretty`, `--terse`, `--schema`, `--absolute`, `--tabular`.
- Project setup includes Code Navigation instruction injection plus optional Codex auto-reindex hook install via `tsift init --codex`.
- `tsift search` now fast-fails on stale existing indexes and adds `--autoindex` for hook-like one-off recovery in unhooked sessions.
- Writable index updates now use a sibling `index.lock` sidecar so concurrent `tsift index` / `tsift search --autoindex` writers fail fast with a tsift-owned lock message instead of raw SQLite lock errors.
- Instruction version markers: `tsift init` now embeds `v=X.Y.Z` in the `<!-- tsift:code-navigation -->` opening marker. `tsift status` reports `instructions: current|stale|missing` and recommends `tsift init` when the installed version differs from the marker version. Pre-versioned markers (no `v=` attribute) are treated as stale.
